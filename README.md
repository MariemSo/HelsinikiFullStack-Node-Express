# Part 3: Helsinki Fullstack Repository

## Purpose

This repository was created for **Exercices-\*\***Part 3\*\* of the Helsinki Fullstack Open course, focusing on backend development. It includes all the required implementations and solutions for the exercises in this part of the course.

## Key Features

This repository covers the following:

- Setting up a backend server using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- Connecting the server to a **MongoDB** database.
- Building a **REST API** for CRUD operations.
- Adding **backend validation** and **error handling**.
- Writing **tests** for the backend functionality.

## Note on Other Parts

The rest of the Helsinki Fullstack exercises and solutions, including Parts 0 through 2 and beyond Part 3, are organized in a separate repository. This approach keeps the projects modular and manageable.

## Why a Separate Repository for Part 3?

The course recommends creating a separate repository for Part 3 to:

- Organize the backend project structure.
- Avoid potential issues with deployment in **Exercise 3.10**.
- Keep the source code aligned with the course requirements.
